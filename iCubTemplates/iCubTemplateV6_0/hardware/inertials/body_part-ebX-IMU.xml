<!--
    This file contains details of how the IMU service is configured. 
    The IMU service gives access to inertial data published by a IMU chip
    possibly located in multiple CAN boards, however all connected to the CAN buses of the same ETH board. 
    The IMU chip so far is the IMU Bosch BNO055, mounted on the CAN boards mtb4, mtb4c, strain2, strain2c and rfe. 
    It exposes: acceleration, gyroscope, magnetometer, euler angle and the status of the chip.  
    
    More details on later tables.

                    The group SENSORS contains the descriptors of the possible sources of inertial data.

                     In here a brief explanation of the properties of the descriptors.
                     - id:          is a string identifier for the descriptor. It must be unique inside this xml file.
                     - sensorName:  is a string with the name of the sensor we want to be published by the relevant 
                                    interface. As an example, is sensor is of type eoas_imu_gyr the interface is 
                                    getThreeAxisGyroscopeName(). If the sensorName parameter is not present the parser 
                                    will get a default sensor name from the above id parameter.                                    
                     - type:        is a string with the type of inertial data retrieved from the IMU. See table below 
                                    for possible values.
                     - boardType:   is a string with the type of CAN board which holds the IMU chip. See table below 
                                    for possible values.
                     - location:    is a string with the CAN location of the board in a format such as CAN1:1
                                    
                    This group can contained as many descriptors as we want, as long as we activate no more than 32 
                    of them inside SETTINGS::enabledSensors.
