      <param name="skipCalibration">    If true, the motion control devices are running, but the calibration procedure is not performed; this means that it is not possible to move joints.
                                        Note: joints have the pwm limited to the values written in "startupMaxPwm" parameter in calibration file.  
                                        Usually this parameter is false. </param>
      <param name="useRawEncoderData">  It is used to read the raw value of joints encoders. Only maintainers should change this parameter. 
                                        ATTENTION: make sure you have pressed the fault button and have set "skipCalibration" parameter to true. </param>
