2 Joints Neck Setup
===================
This setup is a prototype of the neck that will be mounted on `iCub` and `ergoCub`.          
It consists of two motors and can be actuated using `yarprobotinterface` and `yarpmotorgui`.   
One motor is controlled by an `amc` board and the other by an `amcbldc` board.
All the parameters to move the setup are in the configuration files.
