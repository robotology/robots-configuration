Robots Icebox
=============

Since https://github.com/robotology/robots-configuration/pull/533, we moved here those robots that are not under active development, and that are not used in any of our CI systems.

[Show up and ask us](../../../issues/new) to restore your iced robot if you need it.
We will evaluate the request and restore it if it is reasonable.
