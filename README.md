## Installation

### Dependencies
Make sure you have available the following resources:
- [YARP](https://github.com/robotology/yarp)
- [icub-contrib-common](https://github.com/robotology/icub-contrib-common)

### Setting up your Robot
Unless you aim to install the configurations of all robots, you have to specify
the name of your own robot by means of the environment variable **`YARP_ROBOT_NAME`**.
Example:
```sh
export YARP_ROBOT_NAME=iCubGenova01
```

### Build
From the repository root level do:
```sh
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../
$ make install
```
As result, the configurations files of your own robot should be placed in `$ICUBcontrib_DIR/share/ICUBcontrib/robots/$YARP_ROBOT_NAME`.

From this location you may want to tune/modify certain parameters by first copying
out the installed files into user local directories. To this end, rely on the command below:
```sh
$ yarp-config robot --import $YARP_ROBOT_NAME
```

You should end up finding the local copies under `~/.local/share/yarp/robots/$YARP_ROBOT_NAME`.
